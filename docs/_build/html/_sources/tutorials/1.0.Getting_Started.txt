This course was crafted by psychologists, neuropsychologists and neuroscientists for psychologists, neuropsychologists and neuroscientists.
As such, it is a straightforward introduction to Neuropsydia for Python with a special focus on how to actually do something with it.
It is not a programming course on Python, nor a course on programming *per se*.
